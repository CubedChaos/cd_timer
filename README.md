# cd_timer
Count Down Timer datapack for Minecraft as a Boss Bar.


I created this to give a more in your face warning that our server was going to restart in 5 minutes.


To install:

Drop into the world/datapacks folder.
Run "/function cd_timer:install" to create the bossbar scoreboard.

To use:

Run "/function cd_timer:start_timer" to start the timer running.

The default run time is 5 minutes.   To change, set scoreboard players set cdTimer cd_timer to the desired number of seconds before starting the timer.

To cancel a running timer:

Run "/function cd_tiemr:end_timer.


Before removing the datapack, "/function cd_timer:uninstall" will cleanup anything that the datapack set.
